[2023-01-11 16:10:31] Beginning TopHat run (v2.1.0)
-----------------------------------------------
[2023-01-11 16:10:31] Checking for Bowtie
		  Bowtie version:	 2.2.6.0
[2023-01-11 16:10:31] Checking for Bowtie index files (transcriptome)..
[2023-01-11 16:10:31] Checking for Bowtie index files (genome)..
[2023-01-11 16:10:31] Checking for reference FASTA file
[2023-01-11 16:10:31] Generating SAM header for ./annotation/genome/genome
Warning: found a read < 20bp in ./align_rRNA/unmapped.fastq
[2023-01-11 16:10:37] Reading known junctions from GTF file
[2023-01-11 16:11:05] Preparing reads
	 left reads: min. length=18, max. length=35, 9856560 kept reads (170 discarded)
Warning: short reads (<20bp) will make TopHat quite slow and take large amount of memory because they are likely to be mapped in too many places
[2023-01-11 16:12:13] Using pre-built transcriptome data..
[2023-01-11 16:12:19] Mapping left_kept_reads to transcriptome known with Bowtie2 
[2023-01-11 16:19:17] Resuming TopHat pipeline with unmapped reads
Warning: you have only one segment per read.
	If the read length is greater than or equal to 45bp,
	we strongly recommend that you decrease --segment-length to about half the read length because TopHat will work better with multiple segments
[2023-01-11 16:19:18] Mapping left_kept_reads.m2g_um to genome genome with Bowtie2 
[2023-01-11 16:20:17] Searching for junctions via segment mapping
	Coverage-search algorithm is turned on, making this step very slow
	Please try running TopHat again with the option (--no-coverage-search) if this step takes too much time or memory.
